This was the first project I sought to build using React. The goals I had in mind were to familiarise myself more with web development, and learn more technologies and concepts relating to it.

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, and then installing some packages. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was understanding how states work, and how and when to use them. However, during the course of this project, I believe that I have developed a fair understanding of the same. A really interesting thing I came across while building this project was CSS modules. I had seen people use Styled Components in the past, but using CSS modules is just a lot simpler and easier to the eyes.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, JSX and CSS I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize the time that goes into the initial setup.
